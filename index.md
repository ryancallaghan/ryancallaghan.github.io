## About Me
---
 Hi, I'm Ryan! <br><br>
 I am a junior studying Mechanical Engineering at Stevens Institute of Technology. I have experience with 3D computer-aided design, modeling, and simulation using SolidWorks, AutoCAD, Creo and ANSYS. I have a passion for design, and would love to use my passion to help transform someones idea into reality. I also want to develop products that enhance peoples lives. Besides my academic interests, I am a very active person. I have been swimming since I was 5 years old, and enjoy going snowboarding in the winter. I also love spend time with family and friends.
