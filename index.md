## About Me
---
 Hi, I'm Ryan! <br><br>
 I am an engineer passionate about medical devices, wearable devices,  biotechnology, and fitness technology. I am from and currently live in the New York City area. I have a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering and a master's in biomedical engineering, both from Stevens Institute of Technology. I currently work as an R&D engineer at Ethicon, part of Johnson & Johnson's Medtech. Here at Ethicon, I am on the Lifecycle Management team, where we work with R&D aspects of products already on the market. Specifically, some things I have done are: led design change projects on existing products, created and verified a new test method, completed design verification and performance qualification reports, and facilitated change orders for material specification changes.  <br><br> I have experience with 3D computer-aided design, MATLAB, Python, Minitab, Tableau, Excel and drafting technical reports. I want to use my engineering skills to develop medical devices that enhance and even save people's lives. Outside of work, I am a very active person. I have been swimming since I was 5 years old, and enjoy going snowboarding in the winter. I have also ran two half marathons this year, and I am training to compete in the 2024 NYC marathon! 
  <br><br>This website serves to showcase some of the engineering projects I have completed during my academic career.
