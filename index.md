## About Me
---
 Hi, I'm Ryan! <br><br>
 I am a senior studying Mechanical Engineering and concentrating in Biomedical Engineering at Stevens Institute of Technology. I have experience with 3D computer-aided design, drafting technical reports, conducting research on medical products, and working in cross-functional teams. I want to help develop medical devices that enhance and even save people's lives. Besides my work experiences, I am a very active person. I have been swimming since I was 5 years old, and enjoy going snowboarding in the winter. I also love socializing and meeting new people. This website serves to showcase some of the engineering projects I have been a part of during my academic career.
