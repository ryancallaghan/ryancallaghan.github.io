## About Me
---
 Hi, I'm Ryan! <br><br>
 I am a junior studying Mechanical Engineering at Stevens Institute of Technology. I have experience with 3D computer-aided design, modeling, and simulation using SolidWorks, AutoCAD, Creo and ANSYS. I have a passion for design, and would love to use my passion to develop products that enhance peoples lives. In particular, I want to become involved in the medical device and technology industry. Besides my academic interests, I am a very active person, and have been swimming since I was 5 years old. I also love to spend time with family and friends.
